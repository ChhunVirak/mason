# Welcome to [Mason CLI](https://github.com/felangel/mason/tree/master/packages/mason_cli)
Mason is an open source tool that generates code from custom templates called bricks. It can be helpful for developers who find themselves writing the same code over and over again, or those looking for a way to customize reusable templates.

## Why generate?

The usual reasons for using a code generator are given as productivity and consistency because they assume that the solution to a consistent and repetitive problem is to throw more code at it. we can write such a great function or structure but we still rewrite the same structure when we use it thatâ€™s why code generation come and help us.
- template code generate
- structure code generate
