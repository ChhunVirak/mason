# Create Your First Brick

as recommandation we should put all bricks in a folder that should be name bricks

## New Brick

Create a new brick using the 'mason new' command.

```sh
# Generate a new brick in the current directory.
mason new <BRICK_NAME>
# Generate a new brick in custom path.
mason new <BRICK_NAME> --output-dir ./path/to/brick
# Generate a new brick in custom path shorthand syntax.
mason new <BRICK_NAME> -o ./path/to/brick
```

eg.
```sh
mason new greeting
```
output :
```sh
✓ Created new brick: greeting (0.1s)
